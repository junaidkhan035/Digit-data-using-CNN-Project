# Digit-data-using-CNN-Project
This project is structured to build and train a Convolutional Neural Network (CNN) for image classification, likely on a dataset like MNIST for digit recognition. Here's a breakdown of the code and its functionality, step by step:

1. Importing Libraries
numpy, pandas, seaborn, matplotlib: These are essential libraries for numerical computations, data handling, and data visualization.
warnings: The warning filters are applied to avoid unnecessary warnings during execution.
tensorflow.keras and sklearn: These are key libraries for building neural networks (specifically CNNs) and handling model training and evaluation.
2. Label Encoding
to_categorical(): This converts the labels into a one-hot encoded format. In a classification task with multiple classes (like digit recognition, which has 10 classes for digits 0-9), one-hot encoding is a common practice to represent the categorical labels.

Why one-hot encoding?

The neural network outputs probabilities for each class, and having labels in this format makes it easier to calculate loss (using categorical_crossentropy).
Output: After this, y_train has 10 columns, one for each class, and the shape is printed for verification.

3. Train-Test Split
train_test_split(): This function splits the data into training and validation sets. In this case, 30% of the data is set aside for validation, while 70% is used for training. The random state ensures reproducibility of the split.
Shapes are printed: This helps verify that the data has been split correctly.
4. Building the CNN Model
The CNN is built using Sequential(), a stack of layers.

Convolutional Layers:

The first two layers are Convolutional layers with ReLU activations. They use filters of sizes 5x5 and 3x3, which help in detecting features like edges and patterns in the images.
Max Pooling: After each convolution, Max Pooling reduces the spatial dimensions (height and width) of the feature maps, making the computation more efficient and less prone to overfitting.
Dropout Layers: Dropout is used to prevent overfitting by randomly setting some neuron outputs to 0 during training.
Flattening: The Flatten() layer converts the 2D feature maps into a 1D vector so it can be passed into the Dense (fully connected) layers.

Dense Layers:

A dense layer with 256 units and ReLU activation is added. This layer learns the high-level combinations of the extracted features.
Dropout is applied again to prevent overfitting.
Output Layer: A Dense() layer with 10 units and softmax activation is used. Softmax converts the output to probabilities for the 10 classes (0-9).

5. Compiling the Model
Adam Optimizer: The Adam optimizer is used for its efficiency and adaptive learning rate.
Loss Function: The loss function is categorical crossentropy, which is ideal for multi-class classification.
Metrics: The model tracks accuracy during training.
6. Data Augmentation
ImageDataGenerator: Data augmentation is performed to artificially increase the size of the dataset by applying transformations like rotations, zooming, shifting, etc. This helps the model generalize better and reduces overfitting.
Why is this important?

Neural networks often overfit on small datasets. Data augmentation helps create variability and diversity in the training set without collecting new data.
7. Training the Model
The model is trained using the fit() method, which takes augmented training data and the validation data.
The model is trained for 10 epochs with a batch size of 250, meaning 250 samples are processed at a time during training.
Steps per epoch ensures the model trains on the entire dataset after each epoch, considering the batch size.
8. Confusion Matrix
After the model makes predictions on the validation set, the confusion matrix is calculated to show how well the model performed. It compares the true labels (y_true) with the predicted labels (y_pred_classes).
The confusion matrix is visualized using a heatmap, showing how many times the model correctly or incorrectly classified each class.
9. Loading and Visualizing the Data
Data Loading: The train and test datasets are loaded from CSV files.
Label and Features: The y_train variable is created by extracting the labels (digits) from the training data. The x_train variable contains the pixel values of the images, which are then normalized (divided by 255 to scale between 0 and 1).
Visualization:
A count plot shows the distribution of digit classes in the training set.
An individual sample image from the dataset is reshaped to 28x28 pixels and displayed using matplotlib.
10. Normalization and Reshaping
Both x_train and test are normalized to scale the pixel values between 0 and 1, improving training performance.
The data is reshaped to the format expected by the CNN, i.e., 28x28 images with a single grayscale channel (hence the shape (28, 28, 1)).
Overall Workflow:
Data Preparation: Load and split the data, normalize it, and reshape it to fit the CNN input format.
Model Construction: Build a CNN with convolutional layers, max pooling, dropout to reduce overfitting, and dense layers for classification.
Training: Train the model using augmented data and monitor its performance on the validation set.
Evaluation: Use a confusion matrix to evaluate the classification performance.
Data Visualization: Visualize the distribution of classes and individual image samples to understand the dataset.
Key Points for Programmers:
Data Preprocessing: Ensures the dataset is well-suited for training (normalization, reshaping).
CNN Architecture: Makes use of convolutional layers, max pooling, and dropout to build an efficient classifier.
Model Training: Uses augmentation to improve generalization.
Evaluation: Confusion matrix helps understand where the model is making errors.
